  description: "Hey there! I'm Jasper Munene. (Professional Programmer & Code Enthusiast)By day, I'm a professional programmer, but the fun doesn't stop when the clock strikes five! I'm a quick learner who thrives on exploring new technologies.  Unraveling a complex problem with some clever code is my idea of a good time.JavaScript is definitely my coding language of choice (think Captain JavaScript!), but I also have a deep respect for Python's versatility. No matter the web development stack, I'm comfortable jumping in and getting things done.My ultimate mission?  To make the web a more open and accessible space for everyone.Up for a coding challenge or just want to chat tech? Hit me up!",
